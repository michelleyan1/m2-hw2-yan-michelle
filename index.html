<h1>About Michelle</h1>
<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<h3>Painting</h3>
<p>I've been interested in painting since high school. I primarily use gouache which is a type of watercolor and like painting people or architecture. I'm trying to branch out by incorporating more natural or colorful light into my works. Below is something I finished a couple months ago. </p>

<h3>Video Games</h3>
<p>I love playing video games in my free time. A group of friends and I are pretty addicted to the FPS game Valorant and play it almost nightly. It's a great way for me to spend time with my friends through a fun activity when they live far away or if we want to be socially distanced.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p><ol>
    <li>Coffee. I'm trying not to develop a caffeine addiction, but I love coffee from <a href="https://alchemist-coffee-project.cafes-city.com/">Alchemist</a>, especially their New Orlean's coffee which I could drink daily.</li>
    <li>Piano. I just began learning how to play the piano and it's a great way to destress.</li>
    <li>Driving. I don't mind spending time in traffic! I love listening to a podcast or some tunes and getting some me-time before my next destination. </li>
  </ol></p>

<h2>Career Goals</h2>
<p><ul>
    <li>As a Political Communications student, I would like the opportunity to work as a Comms Director in a large electoral campaign or in an elected official's office.</li>
    <li>I'm currently working in a nonprofit, and a huge project is coming up in October. I'm pretty new to the role and would like to succeed in this donor cultivation event.</li>
    <li>I would like to start an online business, one day in the future. It seems tough and a lot of management, but I want to try to sell things online.</li>
  </ul></p>
